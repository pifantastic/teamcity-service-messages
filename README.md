# TeamCity Service Messages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pifantastic/teamcity-service-messages.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pifantastic/teamcity-service-messages)

From the [TeamCity documentation][tcd]:

> If TeamCity doesn't support your testing framework or build runner out of the box, you
> can still avail yourself of many TeamCity benefits by customizing your build scripts to
> interact with the TeamCity server. This makes a wide range of features available to any
> team regardless of their testing frameworks and runners. Some of these features include
> displaying real-time test results and customized statistics, changing the build status,
> and publishing artifacts before the build is finished.

## Installation

```shell
npm install teamcity-service-messages --save
```

## Usage

### Chainable API

```javascript
var tsm = require("teamcity-service-messages");

// It doesn't really make sense that it's chainable. WHATEVER.
tsm.testStarted({ name: "my test" }).testFinished({ name: "my test" });

// You'll more likely use it like this:
tsm.message({ text: "Finished step 1" });

// Do some stuff.
tsm.message({ text: "Finished step 2" });
```

##### Output:

```
##teamcity[testStarted name='my test' flowId='65345909446478' timestamp='2013-12-19T19:54:24.449Z']
##teamcity[testFinished name='my test' flowId='65345909446478' timestamp='2013-12-19T19:54:24.449Z']
```

#### Methods

[Full Documentation][tcd]

- `blockOpened`/`blockClosed`
- `buildNumber`
- `buildProblem`
- `buildStatisticValue`
- `buildStatus`
- `compilationStarted`/`compilationFinished`
- `enableServiceMessages`/`disableServiceMessages`
- `importData`
- `inspection`
- `inspectionType`
- `message`
- `progressMessage`
- `progressStart`/`progressFinish`
- `publishArtifacts`
- `setParameter`
- `testFinished`
- `testIgnored`
- `testMetadata`
- `testStarted`/`testFailed`
- `testStdErr`
- `testStdOut`
- `testSuiteStarted`/`testSuiteFinished`

If you want the messages returned instead of printed to stdout, you can set `tsm.stdout = false`.
The API will no longer be chainable, but instead, each method will return its generated message.

```javascript
var tsm = require("teamcity-service-messages");

tsm.stdout = false;

typeof tsm.message("test"); // string
```

### Low-level API

```javascript
var Message = require("teamcity-service-messages").Message;

var message = new Message("testStarted", {
  name: "my test",
});

console.log(message.toString());
```

##### Output:

```
##teamcity[testStarted name='my test' flowId='65345909446478' timestamp='2013-12-19T19:54:24.449Z']
```
